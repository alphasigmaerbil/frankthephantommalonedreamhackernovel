Frank, my alter ego, sat quietly at the local Pilot Truck stop in Villa Rica, Georgia, USA.  He had just driven cross country from Seattle, via San Francisco and Los Angeles, through the heart of Texas.  He passed through the deserts of the Southwest, past ancient Native American settlements.  He wondered how the spirits of these ancient peoples respond to the contemporary plights of modern Native America.   Now packed onto small plots of land called "reservations," once free, the Native American was and still is caged.  He and I would talk to each other in dreams, resting between the waking hours associated with driving.  At times, the dialogues would yield something substantial, offering insights worth sharing with others.  In snippets, jokes, poems, blog posts, social media trends, and a self-published WordPress blog.  The road journey was, and always will be, an opportunity to connect with fellow humans.  To embrace the gifts that a hard life brings.  To see sweat on the brows of fellow Americans, in any way possible.  In a time of much change, real and imagined.
